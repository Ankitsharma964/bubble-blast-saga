### Problem 1: Cannon Direction

The user may use either a *Long Press* or *Pan Gesture* to select the cannon direction. Pressing anywhere on the game area (which is the entire screen) will activate the *Long Press* Gesture recognizer, and the cannon will immediately turn to face the direction of the user's finger. If that is not enough, the user can then pan around the screen with his finger, and the cannon will automatically follow the user's finger so that the user can define a more accurate direction to fire in. Once the user is satisfied with the cannon angle, he may simply release his finger from the screen and the bubble is fired at the direction his finger was last present at (before release).


### Problem 2: Upcoming Bubbles

As of now, my algorithm for deciding the colors of the next few bubbles is to just generate a random number and get the associated colored bubble according to that random number. Effectively, the upcoming bubbles will be randomly generated.

I am planning to display the current bubble, as well as the next 2 upcoming bubbles after the current bubble.
