 `GameBubble` represents an abstract game bubble in the game.
 This class is meant to be abstract (however, not possible in Swift)
 and not meant to be instantiated.
 
 Since we still need to encode the GameBubbles, it must conform to
 NSCoding and thus implements some empty functions to conform to the protocol.
